This is neat!  I like that you've got the mechanism for the moving pipes set up and there is keyboard control for the bird.  The version I can see at the moment still has the issue where the bird doesn't drop below the middle of the screen.  I also wonder if there's another way to handle the animation so it feels a little more "Flappy"-like.

At this point:

 * do you feel that you understand the code that you have?
 * Do you understand what to change to make adjustments?
 * What would be the first thing you would work on next?
